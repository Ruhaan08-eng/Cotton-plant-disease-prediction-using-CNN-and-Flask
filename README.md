 Cotton Disease Prediction 

 Overview

This project uses a deep learning model (InceptionV3–based CNN) to classify cotton leaf diseases.
The application is deployed using Flask, where users can upload an image and get predictions instantly.

This project demonstrates:
	•	Image preprocessing and augmentation
	•	Transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN
	•	Model training and evaluation
	•	Flask-based web deployment
	•	Real-time image classification workflow

 Model File (Important)

The trained model file (incep.h5) is NOT included in this repository because:
	1.	GitHub does not support large binary files (>100MB)
	2.	Model files are usually stored externally (Drive/S3)
	3.	This keeps the repository lightweight

 Download the trained model from here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R_0u7eGQGP1iIYM1QQQ5CpEIZDX46na-/view

After downloading, place it in the project root like this:

Cotton-Disease-Prediction/
    app.py
    incep.h5    ← place here

 How to Run the Project

1. Install Dependencies

pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy flask pillow

2. Run Flask App

python app.py

3. Open in Browser

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Upload an image → get predictions.

 Model Training (Summary)

The model uses transfer learning based on Google’s InceptionV3:
	•	Input images resized to 299×299 × 3
	•	Frozen base layers of InceptionV3
	•	Added custom Dense layers for classification
	•	Trained on cotton leaf disease dataset
	•	Optimizer: Adam
	•	Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

Training script summary:

base = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
x = Flatten()(base.output)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
model = Model(inputs=base.input, outputs=x)
model.save("incep.h5")

 Features

 Future Enhancements
	•	Deploy on AWS/GCP
	•	Add more crop diseases
	•	Convert model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile
